# GiftMate

GiftMate is a service that allows user to match people for Christmas gift lottery. User need to input participant of the lottery and GiftMate will assign them to each other. For every participant GiftMate will generate unique and one time use only link which will reveal who user will gift.

The service is hosted [here](https://gitftmate.netlify.app/).

## Technology

The service is a good example of integration between [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as it is using:
* Static site hosting and serverless functions from Netlify
* PostgreSQL from Supabase

For analytics it uses [Piwik Pro](https://piwik.pro/).
